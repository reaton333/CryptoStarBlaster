## Reflection

  This project's purpose to dust some personal rust off of my front-end software development skills. I wanted to build a fun engaging game to "show off" my skills set. I have a love for classic 80s style arcade games and inspiration for this game was the classic Galaga game! On the classic Arcade style game route I would love to keep track of high scores in the classic way of only the top 10 scorers and only recording their initials to give it that anonymous aspect.
