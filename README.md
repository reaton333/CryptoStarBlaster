## Reflection

  This project's purpose is to dust some personal rust off of my front-end software development skills. I wanted to build a fun engaging game to "show off" my skill set. I have a love for classic 80s-style arcade games and my inspiration for this game was the classic Galaga game! On the classic Arcade-style game route, I would love to keep track of high scores in the classic way of only the top 10 scorers and only recording their initials to give it that anonymous aspect.
